Schooling in Thailand reflects a rich tapestry of cultural traditions and contemporary educational practices. The Thai education system consists of a mandatory 12-year program, comprising six years of primary education and six years of secondary education. Primary education aims to provide a strong foundation in basic subjects while emphasizing the importance of Thai language, social studies, and values education. Secondary education is divided into lower and upper levels, focusing on a more diverse curriculum, including mathematics, science, social sciences, and languages, preparing students for higher education or vocational training. Additionally, schools often place significant emphasis on instilling moral and ethical values, fostering respect for the monarchy, and nurturing a sense of community and social responsibility among students, thereby shaping well-rounded individuals equipped to contribute to society.
